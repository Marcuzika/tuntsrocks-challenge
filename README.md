# Tunts.Rocks Challenge 🤘🏻

This project was a challenge for the internship position at TuntsRock.

I made this project using JavaScript,
it consumes data from an api and organizes it in a table and at the end, downloads this file in .xlsx format inside the app directory.

## Requirements:
. Node JS installed

## Instructions:
1 - Clone the repository or download
```
git clone https://github.com/Marcuzika/tuntsrocks-challenge
```

2 - Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3 - Run the application
```
npm start
```

4 - After running the app, the .xlsx file will be created inside the app directory.
```
countries-list.xlsx
```
